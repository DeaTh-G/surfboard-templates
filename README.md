# swif-template
010 Editor templates for various versions of the `Surfride Window Information (SWIF)` file format used primarily in Hedgehog Engine games.
The format made its first appearance in `Mario and Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games` developed by `Sega Sports R&D` in 2011.
It's the successor to SEGA's in-house `Ninja` library's GUI format used in games until 2011's `Sonic Generations`.
